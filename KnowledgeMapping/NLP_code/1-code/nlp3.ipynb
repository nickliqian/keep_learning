speak, nephew, were you by when it began? ben. here were the servants of your adversary and yours, close fighting ere i did approach. i drew to part them. in the instant came the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d; which, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears, he swung about his head and cut the winds, who, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn. while we were interchanging thrusts and blows, came more and more, and fought on part and part, till the prince came, who parted either part. m. wife. o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day? right glad i am he was not at this fray. ben. madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun peer\\'d forth the golden window of the east, a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; where, underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city\\'s side, so early walking did i see your son. towards him i made; but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood. i- measuring his affections by my own, which then most sought where most might not be found, being one too many by my weary self- pursu\\'d my humour, not pursuing his, and gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me. mon. many a morning hath he there been seen, with tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew, adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; but all so soon as the all-cheering sun should in the farthest east bean to draw the shady curtains from aurora\\'s bed, away from light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself, shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out and makes himself an artificial night. black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove. ben. my noble uncle, do you know the cause? mon. i neither know it nor can learn of him. ben. have you importun\\'d him by any means? mon. both by myself and many other friends; but he, his own affections\\' counsellor, is to himself- i will not say how true- but to himself so secret and so close, so far from sounding and discovery, as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun. could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, we would as willingly give cure as know. enter romeo. ben. see, where he comes. so please you step aside, i\\'ll know his grievance, or be much denied. mon. i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift. come, madam, let\\'s away, exeunt [montague and wife]. ben. good morrow, cousin. rom. is the day so young? ben. but new struck nine. rom. ah me! sad hours seem long. was that my father that went hence so fast? ben. it was. what sadness lengthens romeo\\'s hours? rom. not having that which having makes them short. ben. in love? rom. out- ben. of love? rom. out of her favour where i am in love. ben. alas that love, so gentle in his view, should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! rom. alas that love, whose view is muffled still, should without eyes see pathways to his will! where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here? yet tell me not, for i have heard it all. here\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love. why then, o brawling love! o loving hate! o anything, of nothing first create! o heavy lightness! serious vanity! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! still-waking sleep, that is not what it is this love feel i, that feel no love in this. dost thou not laugh? ben. no, coz, i rather weep. rom. good heart, at what? ben. at thy good heart\\'s oppression. rom. why, such is love\\'s transgression. griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest with more of thine. this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own. love is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs; being purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes; being vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears. what is it else? a madness most discreet, a choking gall, and a preserving sweet. farewell, my coz. ben. soft! i will go along. an if you leave me so, you do me wrong. rom. tut! i have lost myself; i am not here: this is not romeo, he\\'s some other where. ben. tell me in sadness, who is that you love? rom. what, shall i groan and tell thee? ben. groan? why, no; but sadly tell me who. rom. bid a sick man in sadness make his will. ah, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill! in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman. ben. i aim\\'d so near when i suppos\\'d you lov\\'d. rom. a right good markman! and she\\'s fair i love. ben. a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. rom. well, in that hit you miss. she\\'ll not be hit with cupid\\'s arrow. she hath dian\\'s wit, and, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d, from love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d. she will not stay the siege of loving terms, nor bide th\\' encounter of assailing eyes, nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. o, she\\'s rich in beauty; only poor that, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. ben. then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? rom. she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; for beauty, starv\\'d with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity. she is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, to merit bliss by making me despair. she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now. ben. be rul\\'d by me: forget to think of her. rom. o, teach me how i should forget to think! ben. by giving liberty unto thine eyes. examine other beauties. rom. \\'tis the way to call hers (exquisite) in question more. these happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows, being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost. show me a mistress that is passing fair, what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass\\'d that passing fair? farewell. thou canst not teach me to forget. ben. i\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      exeunt. scene ii. a street. enter capulet, county paris, and [servant] -the clown. cap. but montague is bound as well as i, in penalty alike; and \\'tis not hard, i think, for men so old as we to keep the peace. par. of honourable reckoning are you both, and pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long. but now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

young son, it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. care keeps his watch in every old man\\'s eye, and where care lodges sleep will never lie; but where unbruised youth with unstuff\\'d brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign. therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous\\'d with some distemp\\'rature; or if not so, then here i hit it right- our romeo hath not been in bed to-night. rom. that last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. friar. god pardon sin! wast thou with rosaline?

young men\\'s love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. jesu maria! what a deal of brine hath wash\\'d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline! how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste! the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears. lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash\\'d off yet. if e\\'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline. and art thou chang\\'d?

ben. tybalt, here slain, whom romeo\\'s hand did stay. romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal your high displeasure. all this- uttered with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d- could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio\\'s breast; who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt, whose dexterity retorts it. romeo he cries aloud, \\'hold, friends! friends, part!\\' and swifter than his tongue, his agile arm beats down their fatal points, and \\'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled; but by-and-by comes back to romeo, who had but newly entertain\\'d revenge, and to\\'t they go like lightning; for, ere i could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain; and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly. this is the truth, or let benvolio die. cap. wife. he is a kinsman to the montague; affection makes him false, he speaks not true. some twenty of them fought in this black strife, and all those twenty could but kill one life. i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give. romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live. prince. romeo slew him; he slew mercutio. who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? mon. not romeo, prince; he was mercutio\\'s friend; his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of tybalt. prince. and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence. i have an interest in your hate\\'s proceeding, my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; but i\\'ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine. i will be deaf to pleading and excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. therefore use none. let romeo hence in haste, else, when he is found, that hour is his last. bear hence this body, and attend our will. mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. exeunt. scene ii. capulet\\'s orchard. enter juliet alone. jul. gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards phoebus\\' lodging! such a wagoner as phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately. spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway eyes may wink, and romeo leap to these arms untalk\\'d of and unseen. lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties; or, if love be blind, it best agrees with night. come, civil night, thou sober-suited matron, all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match, play\\'d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods. hood my unmann\\'d blood, bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, think true love acted simple modesty. come, night; come, romeo; come, thou day in night; for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven\\'s back. come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow\\'d night; give me my romeo; and, when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. o, i have bought the mansion of a love, but not possess\\'d it; and though i am sold, not yet enjoy\\'d. so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse, enter nurse, with cords. and she brings news; and every tongue that speaks but romeo\\'s name speaks heavenly eloquence. now, nurse, what news?

is romeo slaught\\'red, and is tybalt dead? my dear-lov\\'d cousin, and my dearer lord? then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! for who is living, if those two are gone? nurse. tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; romeo that kill\\'d him, he is banished. jul. o god! did romeo\\'s hand shed tybalt\\'s blood? nurse. it did, it did! alas the day, it did! jul. o serpent heart, hid with a flow\\'ring face! did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! dove-feather\\'d raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! despised substance of divinest show! just opposite to what thou justly seem\\'st- a damned saint, an honourable villain! o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace! nurse. there\\'s no trust, no faith, no honesty in men; all perjur\\'d, all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. ah, where\\'s my man? give me some aqua vitae. these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. shame come to romeo! jul. blister\\'d be thy tongue for such a wish! he was not born to shame. upon his brow shame is asham\\'d to sit; for \\'tis a throne where honour may be crown\\'d sole monarch of the universal earth. o, what a beast was i to chide at him! nurse. will you speak well of him that kill\\'d your cousin? jul. shall i speak ill of him that is my husband? ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name when i, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? but wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? that villain cousin would have kill\\'d my husband. back, foolish tears, back to your native spring! your tributary drops belong to woe, which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain; and tybalt\\'s dead, that would have slain my husband. all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then? some word there was, worser than tybalt\\'s death, that murd\\'red me. i would forget it fain; but o, it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners\\' minds! \\'tybalt is dead, and romeo- banished.\\' that \\'banished,\\' that one word \\'banished,\\' hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt\\'s death was woe enough, if it had ended there; or, if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank\\'d with other griefs, why followed not, when she said \\'tybalt\\'s dead,\\' thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, which modern lamentation might have mov\\'d? but with a rearward following tybalt\\'s death, \\'romeo is banished\\'- to speak that word is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, all slain, all dead. \\'romeo is banished\\'- there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word\\'s death; no words can that woe sound. where is my father and my mother, nurse? nurse. weeping and wailing over tybalt\\'s corse. will you go to them? i will bring you thither. jul. wash they his wounds with tears? mine shall be spent, when theirs are dry, for romeo\\'s banishment. take up those cords. poor ropes, you are beguil\\'d, both you and i, for romeo is exil\\'d. he made you for a highway to my bed; but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed. come, cords; come, nurse. i\\'ll to my wedding bed; and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead! nurse. hie to your chamber. i\\'ll find romeo to comfort you. i wot well where he is. hark ye, your romeo will be here at night. i\\'ll to him; he is hid at laurence\\' cell. jul. o, find him! give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell. exeunt. scene iii. friar laurence\\'s cell. enter friar [laurence]. friar. romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. affliction is enanmour\\'d of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. enter romeo. rom. father, what news? what is the prince\\'s doom what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not? friar. too familiar is my dear son with such sour company. i bring thee tidings of the prince\\'s doom. rom. what less than doomsday is the prince\\'s doom? friar. a gentler judgment vanish\\'d from his lips- not body\\'s death, but body\\'s banishment. rom. ha, banishment? be merciful, say \\'death\\'; for exile hath more terror in his look, much more than death. do not say \\'banishment.\\' friar. hence from verona art thou banished. be patient, for the world is broad and wide. rom. there is no world without verona walls, but purgatory, torture, hell itself. hence banished is banish\\'d from the world, and world\\'s exile is death. then \\'banishment\\' is death misterm\\'d. calling death \\'banishment,\\' thou cut\\'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me. friar. o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness! thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, taking thy part, hath brush\\'d aside the law, and turn\\'d that black word death to banishment. this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. rom. \\'tis torture, and not mercy. heaven is here, where juliet lives; and every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her; but romeo may not. more validity, more honourable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet\\'s hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips, who, even in pure and vestal modesty, still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; but romeo may not- he is banished. this may flies do, when i from this must fly; they are free men, but i am banished. and sayest thou yet that exile is not death? hadst thou no poison mix\\'d, no sharp-ground knife, no sudden mean of death, though ne\\'er so mean, but \\'banished\\' to kill me- \\'banished\\'? o friar, the damned use that word in hell; howling attends it! how hast thou the heart, being a divine, a ghostly confessor, a sin-absolver, and my friend profess\\'d, to mangle me with that word \\'banished\\'? friar. thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak. rom. o, thou wilt speak again of banishment. friar. i\\'ll give thee armour to keep off that word; adversity\\'s sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, though thou art banished. rom. yet \\'banished\\'? hang up philosophy! unless philosophy can make a juliet, displant a town, reverse a prince\\'s doom, it helps not, it prevails not. talk no more. friar. o, then i see that madmen have no ears. rom. how should they, when that wise men have no eyes? friar. let me dispute with thee of thy estate. rom. thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, an hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me, and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, and fall upon the ground, as i do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave. knock [within]. friar. arise; one knocks. good romeo, hide thyself. rom. not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans, mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          knock. friar. hark, how they knock! who\\'s there? romeo, arise; thou wilt be taken.- stay awhile!- stand up;          knock. run to my study.- by-and-by!- god\\'s will, what simpleness is this.- i come, i come!             knock. who knocks so hard? whence come you? what\\'s your will? nurse. [within] let me come in, and you shall know my errand. i come from lady juliet. friar. welcome then. enter nurse. nurse. o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar, where is my lady\\'s lord, where\\'s romeo? friar. there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. nurse. o, he is even in my mistress\\' case, just in her case! friar. o woeful sympathy! piteous predicament! nurse. even so lies she, blubb\\'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering. stand up, stand up! stand, an you be a man. for juliet\\'s sake, for her sake, rise and stand! why should you fall into so deep an o? rom. (rises) nurse- nurse. ah sir! ah sir! well, death\\'s the end of all. rom. spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her? doth not she think me an old murtherer, now i have stain\\'d the childhood of our joy with blood remov\\'d but little from her own? where is she? and how doth she! and what says my conceal\\'d lady to our cancell\\'d love? nurse. o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; and now falls on her bed, and then starts up, and tybalt calls; and then on romeo cries, and then down falls again. rom. as if that name, shot from the deadly level of a gun, did murther her; as that name\\'s cursed hand murder\\'d her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me, in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sack the hateful mansion.                     [draws his dagger.] friar. hold thy desperate hand. art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art; thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast. unseemly woman in a seeming man! or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! thou hast amaz\\'d me. by my holy order, i thought thy disposition better temper\\'d. hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? and slay thy lady that in thy life lives, by doing damned hate upon thyself? why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, which, like a usurer, abound\\'st in all, and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man; thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, killing that love which thou hast vow\\'d to cherish; thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, misshapen in the conduct of them both, like powder in a skilless soldier\\'s flask, is set afire by thine own ignorance, and thou dismemb\\'red with thine own defence. what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive, for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead. there art thou happy. tybalt would kill thee, but thou slewest tybalt. there art thou happy too. the law, that threat\\'ned death, becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. there art thou happy. a pack of blessings light upon thy back; happiness courts thee in her best array; but, like a misbehav\\'d and sullen wench, thou pout\\'st upon thy fortune and thy love. take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. go get thee to thy love, as was decreed, ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her. but look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to mantua, where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went\\'st forth in lamentation. go before, nurse. commend me to thy lady, and bid her hasten all the house to bed, which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto. romeo is coming. nurse. o lord, i could have stay\\'d here all the night to hear good counsel. o, what learning is! my lord, i\\'ll tell my lady you will come. rom. do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. nurse. here is a ring she bid me give you, sir. hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           exit. rom. how well my comfort is reviv\\'d by this! friar. go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: either be gone before the watch be set, or by the break of day disguis\\'d from hence. sojourn in mantua. i\\'ll find out your man, and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here. give me thy hand. \\'tis late. farewell; good night. rom. but that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief so brief to part with thee. farewell. exeunt. scene iv. capulet\\'s house enter old capulet, his wife, and paris. cap. things have fall\\'n out, sir, so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter. look you, she lov\\'d her kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did i. well, we were born to die. \\'tis very late; she\\'ll not come down to-night. i promise you, but for your company, i would have been abed an hour ago. par. these times of woe afford no tune to woo. madam, good night. commend me to your daughter. lady. i will, and know her mind early to-morrow; to-night she\\'s mew\\'d up to her heaviness. cap. sir paris, i will make a desperate tender of my child\\'s love. i think she will be rul\\'d in all respects by me; nay more, i doubt it not. wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; acquaint her here of my son paris\\' love and bid her (mark you me?) on wednesday next- but, soft! what day is this? par. monday, my lord. cap. monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon. thursday let it be- a thursday, tell her she shall be married to this noble earl. will you be ready? do you like this haste? we\\'ll keep no great ado- a friend or two; for hark you, tybalt being slain so late, it may be thought we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much. therefore we\\'ll have some half a dozen friends, and there an end. but what say you to thursday? par. my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow. cap. well, get you gone. a thursday be it then. go you to juliet ere you go to bed; prepare her, wife, against this wedding day. farewell, my lord.- light to my chamber, ho! afore me, it is so very very late that we may call it early by-and-by. good night. exeunt scene v. capulet\\'s orchard. enter romeo and juliet aloft, at the window. jul. wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day. it was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierc\\'d the fearful hollow of thine ear. nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. believe me, love, it was the nightingale. rom. it was the lark, the herald of the morn; no nightingale. look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. night\\'s candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. i must be gone and live, or stay and die. jul. yond light is not daylight; i know it, i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on the way to mantua. therefore stay yet; thou need\\'st not to be gone. rom. let me be ta\\'en, let me be put to death. i am content, so thou wilt have it so. i\\'ll say yon grey is not the morning\\'s eye, \\'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia\\'s brow; nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads. i have more care to stay than will to go. come, death, and welcome! juliet wills it so. how is\\'t, my soul? let\\'s talk; it is not day. jul. it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away! it is the lark that sings so out of tune, straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. some say the lark makes sweet division; this doth not so, for she divideth us. some say the lark and loathed toad chang\\'d eyes; o, now i would they had chang\\'d voices too, since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, hunting thee hence with hunt\\'s-up to the day! o, now be gone! more light and light it grows. rom. more light and light- more dark and dark our woes! enter nurse. nurse. madam! jul. nurse? nurse. your lady mother is coming to your chamber. the day is broke; be wary, look about. jul. then, window, let day in, and let life out. [exit.] rom. farewell, farewell! one kiss, and i\\'ll descend. he goeth down. jul. art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend? i must hear from thee every day in the hour, for in a minute there are many days. o, by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo! rom. farewell! i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings, love, to thee. jul. o, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet again? rom. i doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come. jul. o god, i have an ill-divining soul! methinks i see thee, now thou art below, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. either my eyesight fails, or thou look\\'st pale. rom. and trust me, love, in my eye so do you. dry sorrow drinks our blood. adieu, adieu! exit. jul. o fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle. if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him that is renown\\'d for faith? be fickle, fortune, for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back. lady. [within] ho, daughter! are you up? jul. who is\\'t that calls? it is my lady mother. is she not down so late, or up so early? what unaccustom\\'d cause procures her hither? enter mother. lady. why, how now, juliet? jul. madam, i am not well. lady. evermore weeping for your cousin\\'s death? what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? an if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. therefore have done. some grief shows much of love; but much of grief shows still some want of wit. jul. yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. lady. so shall you feel the loss, but not the friend which you weep for. jul. feeling so the loss, i cannot choose but ever weep the friend. lady. well, girl, thou weep\\'st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter\\'d him. jul. what villain, madam? lady. that same villain romeo. jul. [aside] villain and he be many miles asunder.- god pardon him! i do, with all my heart; and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. lady. that is because the traitor murderer lives. jul. ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. would none but i might venge my cousin\\'s death! lady. we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. then weep no more. i\\'ll send to one in mantua, where that same banish\\'d runagate doth live, shall give him such an unaccustom\\'d dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company; and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied. jul. indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him- dead- is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex\\'d. madam, if you could find out but a man to bear a poison, i would temper it; that romeo should, upon receipt thereof, soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhors to hear him nam\\'d and cannot come to him, to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt upon his body that hath slaughter\\'d him! lady. find thou the means, and i\\'ll find such a man. but now i\\'ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. jul. and joy comes well in such a needy time. what are they, i beseech your ladyship? lady. well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; one who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects not nor i look\\'d not for. jul. madam, in happy time! what day is that? lady. marry, my child, early next thursday morn the gallant, young, and noble gentleman, the county paris, at saint peter\\'s church, shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. jul. now by saint peter\\'s church, and peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride! i wonder at this haste, that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo. i pray you tell my lord and father, madam, i will not marry yet; and when i do, i swear it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate, rather than paris. these are news indeed! lady. here comes your father. tell him so yourself, and see how he will take it at your hands. enter capulet and nurse. cap. when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, but for the sunset of my brother\\'s son it rains downright. how now? a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? evermore show\\'ring? in one little body thou counterfeit\\'st a bark, a sea, a wind: for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea, do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs, who, raging with thy tears and they with them, without a sudden calm will overset thy tempest-tossed body. how now, wife? have you delivered to her our decree? lady. ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. i would the fool were married to her grave! cap. soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. how? will she none? doth she not give us thanks? is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? jul. not proud you have, but thankful that you have. proud can i never be of what i hate, but thankful even for hate that is meant love. cap. how now, how now, choplogic?

famine is in thy cheeks, need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back: the world is not thy friend, nor the world\\'s law; the world affords no law to make thee rich; then be not poor, but break it and take this. apoth. my poverty but not my will consents. rom. i pay thy poverty and not thy will. apoth. put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off, and if you had the strength of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. rom. there is thy gold- worse poison to men\\'s souls, doing more murther in this loathsome world, than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. farewell. buy food and get thyself in flesh. come, cordial and not poison, go with me to juliet\\'s grave; for there must i use thee. exeunt. scene ii. verona. friar laurence\\'s cell. enter friar john to friar laurence. john. holy franciscan friar, brother, ho! enter friar laurence. laur. this same should be the voice of friar john. welcome from mantua. what says romeo?

prince. look, and thou shalt see. mon. o thou untaught! what manners is in this, to press before thy father to a grave? prince. seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring, their head, their true descent; and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death. meantime forbear, and let mischance be slave to patience. bring forth the parties of suspicion. friar. i am the greatest, able to do least, yet most suspected, as the time and place doth make against me, of this direful murther; and here i stand, both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus\\'d. prince. then say at once what thou dost know in this. friar. i will be brief, for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale. romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet; and she, there dead, that romeo\\'s faithful wife. i married them; and their stol\\'n marriage day was tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death banish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city; for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin\\'d. you, to remove that siege of grief from her, betroth\\'d and would have married her perforce to county paris. then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage, or in my cell there would she kill herself. then gave i her (so tutored by my art) a sleeping potion; which so took effect as i intended, for it wrought on her the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave, being the time the potion\\'s force should cease. but he which bore my letter, friar john, was stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight return\\'d my letter back. then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred\\'s vault; meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo. but when i came, some minute ere the time of her awaking, here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead. she wakes; and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience; but then a noise did scare me from the tomb, and she, too desperate, would not go with me, but, as it seems, did violence on herself. all this i know, and to the marriage her nurse is privy; and if aught in this miscarried by my fault, let my old life be sacrific\\'d, some hour before his time, unto the rigour of severest law. prince. we still have known thee for a holy man. where\\'s romeo\\'s man? what can he say in this? bal. i brought my master news of juliet\\'s death; and then in post he came from mantua to this same place, to this same monument. this letter he early bid me give his father, and threat\\'ned me with death, going in the vault, if i departed not and left him there. prince. give me the letter. i will look on it. where is the county\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch? sirrah, what made your master in this place? boy. he came with flowers to strew his lady\\'s grave; and bid me stand aloof, and so i did. anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; and by-and-by my master drew on him; and then i ran away to call the watch. prince. this letter doth make good the friar\\'s words, their course of love, the tidings of her death; and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary, and therewithal came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet. where be these enemies? capulet, montague, see what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! and i, for winking at you, discords too, have lost a brace of kinsmen. all are punish\\'d. cap. o brother montague, give me thy hand. this is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more can i demand. mon. but i can give thee more; for i will raise her statue in pure gold, that whiles verona by that name is known, there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet. cap. as rich shall romeo\\'s by his lady\\'s lie- poor sacrifices of our enmity! prince. a glooming peace this morning with it brings. the sun for sorrow will not show his head. go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; some shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished; for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo. exeunt omnes. the end <<this electronic version of the complete works of william shakespeare is copyright 1990-1993 by world library, inc., and is provided by project gutenberg etext of carnegie mellon university with permission.  electronic and machine readable copies may be distributed so long as such copies (1) are for your or others personal use only, and (2) are not distributed or used commercially.  prohibited commercial distribution includes by any service that charges for download time or for membership.>> end of this etext of the complete works of william shakespeare the tragedy of romeo and juliet '"
